# work-day-scheduler

## Description
For this week's challenge I used jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js to build a 9-5 workday scheduler to help an employee keep track of meetings. There are 1 hour timeblocks between 9-5 that are also color coded to easily read your schedule. Gray blocks are times that are past, red is for the current hour, and green are upcoming hours.
